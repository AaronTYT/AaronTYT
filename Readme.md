## 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron Tan (GitHub: AaronTYT)
🚀 Aspiring **AI Engineer & Technologist** | Software Engineering × Data × AI

Welcome to my GitHub 👋  
This space showcases my journey from **software development** into **AI and data-driven systems**, with a focus on building practical, end-to-end solutions rather than isolated models.

My projects sit at the intersection of:
- **Software engineering**
- **Machine learning & analytics**
- **Real-world business and operational problems** (especially in mining & industry)

---

## 🧠 About Me
- 🎯 Transitioning from **Software Development** into **AI / Data Engineering**
- 💻 Hands-on with **Python, SQL, Streamlit**, and cloud platforms (**AWS, Snowflake**)
- 🤖 Experience across **ML pipelines, model evaluation, and deployment concepts**
- 🔬 Industry exposure through a **Data Science Internship at FMG**
- 📈 Strong interest in **production-aware AI**, analytics storytelling, and decision support
- 🌱 Continuously improving through structured projects, experimentation, and learning

---

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here
- 📊 **Data analysis & visualisation projects**
- 🤖 **Machine learning models** (supervised learning, NLP, computer vision)
- 🧪 End-to-end prototypes (EDA → model → app/dashboard)
- 🛠️ Streamlit apps and deployment-ready demos
- 📝 Clear READMEs explaining *why* a solution exists, not just *how*

I focus on **clarity, reproducibility, and business relevance** rather than one-off notebooks.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Beyond Tech — Powerlifting
Outside of tech, I train and compete in **powerlifting**.  
The sport has shaped how I approach engineering:

- 📐 Progressive overload → iterative improvement  
- 📊 Training data → performance optimisation  
- 🧠 Discipline & consistency → long-term results  

The same mindset applies to building reliable AI systems.
