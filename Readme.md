## 👋 Hi there, I'm Aaron Tan (GitHub: AaronTYT)
🚀 Currently on a journey to become an **AI Engineer & Technologist**

Welcome to my GitHub!  
Employers, developers, and students — feel free to explore my coding projects and AI/ML experiments. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that connect **software engineering** with **data-driven insight**.

### 🧠 About Me
- 🎯 Transitioning from **software development** into **AI engineering**
- 💻 Skilled in **Python, SQL, Streamlit, and cloud technologies (AWS, Snowflake)**
- 🧩 Focused on **machine learning, model deployment, and analytics storytelling**
- 🔬 Hands-on experience from my **FMG Data Science Internship**
- 🌱 Constantly improving through **projects, learning, and curiosity**

### 🏋️‍♂️ Beyond Tech — Powerlifting
When I’m not coding, I’m training to push my limits in **powerlifting** — a sport that’s taught me **discipline, progressive growth, and data-driven improvement**.  
I believe the same principles that apply under the barbell — **consistency, precision, and resilience** — also apply to AI development.
